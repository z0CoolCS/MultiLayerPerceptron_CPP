# MultiLayerPerceptron_CPP
This is an implementation of a multilayer perceptron in C++. We used the Eigen Library based on C++ to implement the matrix operationes. 

For every project we need a team to be able to achieve our goals. The team members for this project are:
- Giordano Alvitez - [z0CoolCS](https://github.com/z0CoolCS)
- Jorge Rebosio - [JRebosio](https://github.com/JRebosio)
